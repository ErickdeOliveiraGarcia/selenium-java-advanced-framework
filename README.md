üõ°Ô∏è Professional Test Automation Framework (Java/Selenium)

This repository contains a robust, scalable, and professional Test Automation Framework built in Java. 
It follows best practices and advanced design patterns to ensure test stability, maintainability, and enterprise-level reporting.

üèóÔ∏è Architectural Design & Best Practices
The framework is designed for scalability and maintainability, incorporating the following principles:

1. Page Object Model (POM) with Page Factory
All web page interactions are encapsulated in dedicated classes (pages/).

Locators are managed using the @FindBy annotation and initialized via Page Factory.

2. Robustness and Reliability
Explicit Waits (WaitUtils): Custom utility to handle synchronization issues, drastically reducing test flakiness.

Test Retry Analyzer: Implemented using IRetryAnalyzer to automatically re-run failed tests up to 2 times, mitigating transient failures (network, environment).

3. Professional Reporting
Allure Reports: Integration is set up to generate comprehensive and visual reports.

Screenshots on Failure: (Upcoming) Automatic capture of evidence on test failure, linked directly into the Allure report.

‚öôÔ∏è Setup & Execution
Prerequisites
Java Development Kit (JDK 17 or higher)
Apache Maven
Git
Allure Command Line Tool (required to view reports locally)

1. Clone the Repository
git clone [YOUR_REPOSITORY_LINK]
cd [repository-folder]

2. Install Dependencies
mvn clean install

3. Running the Test Suite
mvn clean test

4. Viewing Allure Reports
allure serve

ü§ù Next Steps & Future Features
The following modules are planned to complete the full-stack framework:

1. API Testing: Integrate RestAssured to create API tests.
2. Full-Stack Validation: Implement JDBC to validate data consistency in the database.
3. Continuous Integration: Setup a GitHub Actions pipeline to execute tests automatically on push.
