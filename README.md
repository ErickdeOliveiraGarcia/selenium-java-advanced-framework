A robust Test Automation Framework for UI and API testing, built with Selenium, Java, and TestNG. This project demonstrates a scalable and maintainable architecture for enterprise-level test automation.

## ✨ Key Features

-   **UI & API Testing**: Comprehensive test suites for both web interfaces and RESTful APIs.
-   **Page Object Model (POM)**: For clean, maintainable, and reusable UI test code.
-   **Centralized API Client**: A reusable RestAssured setup for streamlined API testing.
-   **Multi-Browser Support**: Easily configurable for Chrome, Firefox, and other browsers.
-   **Headless Execution**: Run UI tests in a headless environment, perfect for CI/CD pipelines.
-   **Allure Reports**: Generate beautiful, interactive, and detailed test reports, published to GitHub Pages.
-   **CI/CD with GitHub Actions**: Automated build, test, and reporting pipeline.
-   **Secure API Key Management**: Loads API keys from environment variables, system properties, or a local `.env` file.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

-   **Java 17**
-   **Selenium WebDriver**: For browser automation.
-   **TestNG**: As the testing framework.
-   **RestAssured**: For REST API testing.
-   **Apache Maven**: For dependency management and building the project.
-   **Allure Framework**: For test reporting.
-   **GitHub Actions**: For CI/CD.

```

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   **JDK 17** or higher.
-   **Apache Maven**.
-   **Google Chrome** or **Mozilla Firefox**.
-   **Allure Commandline**: Required to generate reports locally. For Windows, you can install it using [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/):
    ```bash
    scoop install allure
    ```
    For other operating systems, see the official [installation guide](https://allurereport.org/docs/gettingstarted-installation/).

### Local Setup & Execution

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Erick-oGarcia/JavaTestMatrix.git
    cd JavaTestMatrix
    ```

2.  **API Key Configuration (Optional):**
    For API tests, create a `.env` file in the project root and add your API key:
    ```
    API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
    ```

3.  **Run Tests:**
    -   **Run all tests:**
        ```bash
        mvn clean test
        ```
    -   **Run a specific TestNG suite:**
        ```bash
        mvn clean test -Dsurefire.suiteXmlFiles=testng.xml
        ```

## 📊 Allure Reports

After running the tests, generate and view the Allure report from the project's root directory:

```bash
allure serve allure-results
```
Alternatively, you can access the automatically generated Allure Report via GitHub Pages, which is deployed to the `allure-reports` branch. The link is typically: `https://Erick-oGarcia.github.io/JavaTestMatrix/`

## 🔄 CI/CD Pipeline

This project uses **GitHub Actions** for continuous integration and continuous deployment of Allure Reports.

-   **`ci-pipeline.yml`**: The main workflow runs on every `push` or `pull_request` to the `main` branch, executing tests and uploading Allure results as artifacts.
-   **`allure-report.yml`**: This workflow is triggered upon completion of `ci-pipeline.yml`. It downloads the Allure results, generates the report, and deploys it to GitHub Pages on the `allure-reports` branch.
-   **Secrets**: For the pipeline to run API tests successfully, you must add your API key as a secret in your GitHub repository:
    -   Navigate to `Settings` > `Secrets and variables` > `Actions`.
    -   Create a new secret named `API_KEY` with your API key as the value.

## 🔮 Future Improvements

-   [ ] Integrate with a cloud testing platform (e.g., BrowserStack, Sauce Labs).
-   [ ] Implement visual regression testing.
-   [ ] Add support for containerized execution with Docker.
-   [ ] Increase test coverage for API and UI modules.
